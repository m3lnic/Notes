# Roses ... The Plannening
## Disclaimer
This document is a planning document. It is very much so likely to change as plans become more solid. As they do become more solid, we will begin writing a new document / other documents with outlines of what is happening.

We will attempt to get a timetable as soon as possible.

This could also be a lot of text. Please be sure to read it though.

## 1. When is Roses
Roses is in the First week of May. This covers the following days:
- Friday 1st May
- Saturday 2nd May
- Sunday 3rd May

We will be targeting for York equipment to be at Lancaster from the Wednesday (29th April) before the first day. We will organise alongside York to find the best method for getting it here.

## 2. What is Roses?
Roses is an annual inter-university sports competition between the 2 Roses - Lancaster University and York University. It is a very busy week / weekend for student media as we typically try and stream out the sports. The 2 roses can be seen below:

Remember that Roses are red! If you're from york. Then they are red too!

More information regarding the Roses sports competition can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roses_Tournament) (It's a wikipedia link).

## 3. Streaming Outline
This year we will be targeting 4 "Quality streams" per day. These OB kits will be left streaming during the day to provide full day coverage. The goal is to not have to move any setups after friday.

The current ideas are to have BFM / URY providing voice coverage over the LA1TV visuals. My recommendation is that coverage is then seperated / cloned in LA1TV Control Room to be sent to BFM / URY's relative streaming platform. They can then send this URL out for people to listen as a voice recording. 

Graphics will be present during roses and will be simple. However, multiple people will be trained on how to setup and fix this system. We will more than likely use dedicated machines for this if possible.

> Check who is available from YSTV to learn how to setup our graphics packages / test them on their encoder.

Studio shows will be organised at a future date. Any student media is welcome to present / produce their own show. If any student media members from either university would like to present but do not know of how to, please drop me ([Mel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013276411331)) a message on facebook and I will forward you to the correct person (Hopefully we can get you on screen somehow).

> Update with correct person later

One OB Kit will be moved / stopped from wherever it is placed and back to one of the sports halls when necessary. This stream will be in the sports hall with the least interesting sports in. This OB Kit should be small, compact and easy to move.

## 4. Streaming hardware
We shall be requesting that all OB encoders have OBS installed on. There will be no additional requirements (besides possibly a password requirement). 

> If YSTV could set the password to their encoder to something like "Roses2019" so that if no York member is around, we can still fix technical issues. LA1TV will do something similar.

We shall be requesting that only people with a good understanding of blackmagic equipment mess about with the internals of the OB kits. This goes for all societies. This is because they will be wired to work and nothing should need to be changed internally.

> Wiring diagrams for LA1TV OB kits will be made at some point and inserted into this document.

### LA1TV 
#### OB 1 / 2 (2x OB Kits)
- 2 ME ATEM
- VideoHub
- Hyperdeck
- Encoder
- Graphics

#### OB 3
- Production Studio 4K
- Encoder
- Hyperdeck
- Graphics

### BFM
> They have some streaming equipment that could be used. May need to get permission to use it. Need to fix VideU for them still.

### YSTV
> Can YSTV let us know what kit they have so we can factor it into the plans.

## 5. Alumni plans
Alumni are there to help and not run Roses. As such, we will give them tasks where there expertise is useful but at the same time, it does not withdraw from the experiences that other people can gain. As such some example tasks for alumni are:
- Manning TX
- Helping with setups
- Fixing MAJOR technical issues
- Teaching members stuff they know

## 6. Studio Shows
> Discuss with people what we think the best way to sort this is.

## 7. Training
> Leon said he would write something up.

## 8. BFM
> UNKNOWN

## 9. SCAN
> UNKNOWN

## 10. Meetings
This is where minutes for the meetings will be placed as well as possible audio recordings.
> Please get permission for audio recording the meetings.
- 29th January 2020 @ 1700 (05:00pm)
