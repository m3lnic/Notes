## 1. When is Roses
Roses is in the First week of May. This covers the following days:
- Friday 1st May
- Saturday 2nd May
- Sunday 3rd May

We will be targeting for York equipment to be at Lancaster from the Wednesday (29th April) before the first day. We will organise alongside York to find the best method for getting it here.

## 2. What is Roses?
Roses is an annual inter-university sports competition between the 2 Roses - Lancaster University and York University. It is a very busy week / weekend for student media as we typically try and stream out the sports. The 2 roses can be seen below:

Remember that Roses are red! If you're from york. Then they are red too!

More information regarding the Roses sports competition can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roses_Tournament) (It's a wikipedia link).

## 3. Streaming Outline
This year we will be targeting 4 "Quality streams" per day. These OB kits will be left streaming during the day to provide full day coverage. The goal is to not have to move any setups after friday.

The current ideas are to have BFM / URY providing voice coverage over the LA1TV visuals. My recommendation is that coverage is then seperated / cloned in LA1TV Control Room to be sent to BFM / URY's relative streaming platform. They can then send this URL out for people to listen as a voice recording. 

Graphics will be present during roses and will be simple. However, multiple people will be trained on how to setup and fix this system. We will more than likely use dedicated machines for this if possible.

> Check who is available from YSTV to learn how to setup our graphics packages / test them on their encoder.

Studio shows will be organised at a future date. Any student media is welcome to present / produce their own show. There will be no discrimination as to who is picked. If any other student media members would like to present, please drop me ([Mel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013276411331)) a message on facebook and I will forward you to the correct person.

> Update with correct person later
