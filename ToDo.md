    > Some people reading this may say that the website is perfectly fine. Coming at it from my side of things. The front end is outdated. The API usage feels clunky and overly complicated. We need something that is written modularly that is quick to fix, or take down individual components that break. Something continuously maintainable that doesn't rely on in depth knowledge of PHP or Complex frameworks. Something that can provide LA1 the front image and face lift that it deserves. This is me speaking without constraint.
